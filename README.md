# Get Started

This project needs to create react application without
Create-React-App

All what u need is a clone the project and:

```
rmdir .git
```
```
npm install || yarn
```
## React-Configuration

This config is a standard config for React app. If you need to configure 
the application's reaction in more detail than the CRA does you can
use this project

## Global environments
In this project all global environments available in window.globals . Default env is APP_IP.
If u need more env's go to env file at the root and add all env's
what u need. After that go to config/get-globals.js and add these env's
to window.globals. After all webpack will do his work. :)

This is necessary in order to access the environment 
variables in the frontend when the application is deployed

Good hacking :)
